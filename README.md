- Here is the flowchart (in comic sans!)for the whole game (the program starts in the white circle on top of the 
flowchart).

- There are some redundant states, with redundant transitions. This was done deliberately to be more specific with certain 
exceptional states, like a player that reaches Norma level 6, or a Player that decides to stop on their Home Panel.
- Also, the effects of Bonus, Drop and Neutral Panel have been grouped together. This is because they do not present any
special transition to a new state, and are relatively self-contained.
- The combat flowchart has been generalized for both Player vs WildUnit and Player vs Player.
